# Running Injury Prediction Project

This notebook explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict running injuries using biomechanical data. It includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Introduction

Running is one of the most popular sports globally, but injuries are common among runners. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict running injuries using biomechanical data.

## Data Loading and Exploration

The [**dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/injury-prediction-for-competitive-runners) is loaded directly from **Kaggle** and explored to understand its structure and contents.

## Data Preprocessing

Unnecessary columns are dropped from the dataset to prepare it for further analysis.

## Data Visualization

Individual athlete data is visualized to gain insights into patterns and trends.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The data is split into features and target variables, and a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier is trained and evaluated.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into the potential of machine learning for predicting running injuries. While the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier shows promising results, there are areas for further improvement, such as feature engineering and exploring alternative models.
