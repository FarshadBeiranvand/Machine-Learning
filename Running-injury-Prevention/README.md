# Running Injury Prediction Project

This notebook explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict running injuries using biomechanical data. It includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

**_The project will be regularly updated to incorporate better methods, improve model performance, and explore alternative machine learning algorithms_**

## Introduction

Running is one of the most popular sports globally, but injuries are common among runners. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict running injuries using biomechanical data.

## Data Loading and Exploration

The dataset is loaded directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/injury-prediction-for-competitive-runners) and explored to understand its structure and contents.

## Data Visualization

Individual athlete data is visualized to gain insights into patterns and trends. *(You can include your visualization code and resulting visualizations here)*

## Model Training and Evaluation

The data is split into features and target variables, and a Random Forest classifier is trained and evaluated.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into the potential of machine learning for predicting running injuries. While the Random Forest classifier shows promising results, there are areas for further improvement, such as feature engineering and exploring alternative models.
