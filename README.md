# Running Injury Prediction Project

## Introduction

Running is one of the most popular sports in the world, with millions of participants each year. However, injuries are common among runners, with approximately 50% experiencing some form of injury annually. In this project, we aim to explore how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict running injuries using biomechanical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/injury-prediction-for-competitive-runners). 

## How to Use

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset directly from Kaggle using the provided link and explore its contents.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data by dropping unnecessary columns.
   
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize individual athlete data to gain insights into the patterns.
   
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Split the data into features and target variables, then train a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier. Finally, evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

## Conclusion

In this project, we embarked on an exploration of machine learning's potential to predict running injuries using biomechanical data. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, visualization, and model training, we gained valuable insights into the patterns and trends associated with running injuries. While our K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier exhibited high accuracy in identifying non-injury cases, its performance in detecting injuries was limited, suggesting areas for further improvement. Future endeavors could involve delving deeper into feature engineering, addressing class imbalance, and exploring alternative models or ensemble methods. By continuing to refine our approaches and collaborating with domain experts, we aim to develop more robust predictive models that can aid in injury prevention and enhance the overall well-being of athletes.
